# Solution to the programming challenge.
To test the code you have several options such as:

1: clone the repository on your local machine and run it, you just need to have python installed.
- Como instalar [Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).
- `git clone https://github.com/Yesid4Code/TeamInternationalTestCode`

2: Copy the code into your favorite code editor and run the solution.

3: run the code on your terminal: python3 HackerLand.py

4: Analyze the results.


n = meters long of the stage.

m = number of lights above the stage.

lights:
- is a list of list,
- Here you can add more elements as a list for test it.
- each element is sent to the algorithm with the help of a for loop.


## Notes
1: I guess some tests fail, but the main logic is in the algorithm.

2: The solution to this exercise will only be available during the selection stage.
